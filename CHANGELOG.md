## Changelog

This file is not updated anymore. It lists the changes up to v0.9.0. For v0.10.0 to v0.16.0, see the [upstream releases](https://github.com/manicminer/gitlab-migrator/releases). Newer releases have generated release notes on the [releases page](https://github.com/sebingel/gitlab-migrator/releases).

### v0.9.0

- Update `github.com/google/go-github` to v74
- Use [Advanced Issue Search](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-03-06-github-issues-projects-api-support-for-issues-advanced-search-and-more/) to reduce the resultset when trying to match an existing PR, to try to avoid missing existing PRs and then creating a duplicate
- Support subgroups in GitLab
- Support renaming trunk branch in GitLab repo to any arbitrary branch name on the GitHub repo

### v0.8.0

- Attempt to log the message from the response for a failed API request to GitHub

### v0.7.0

- Ensure repo description has no newlines/returns
- Correctly match "already up-to-date" error
- Always create temporary source/target branches for closed MRs, otherwise we will inadvertently try to create a PR against current trunk branch (which will already have the changes)
- Set the PR state before attempting to update it, to avoid GH erroring with "Cannot change the base branch of a closed pull request"

### v0.6.0

- Push tags from gitlab to github
- Don't retry when receiving a 403 with SAML enforcement error

### v0.5.0

- Follow tags when pushing trunk branch

### v0.4.0

- Don't set 'maintainer_can_modify' when updating a PR, since only the author can do that and we might be using a different user's token
- Emit an error when we encounter an orphaned MR starting commit
- Attempt to find a suitable base commit from which to branch when scaffolding a PR branch, should now handle merge commits

### v0.3.0

- Return non-zero exit status when errors occurred during a migration
